                    Long Ago there lived a Lion in a Jungle. Everyday it went out to hunt animals to eat. One day it started hunting animals but 
                    unfortunately on that day it cannot find any animal to kill. Then the lion has no idea about what to do and he thought 
                    if it happens daily it wont get food to eat.
    
                </p><br>

                    To the Fox the Lion said " My health condition is not good. I don't know how many days i will leave. I wish to see all the 
                    animals." and requested the Fox to spread the news to all the animals. Knowing that it was true Fox spread the nows to everyone.
                    From the next day one-by-one animals went to see the Lion in his cave.

                    cave and on watching those two rabbits fox started conversation with them. In the middle of the conversation 
                    Fox knew that Yesterday a Deer went into the lion's cave and didn't come out till now. Thinking about this Suspecious

                <p style="text-indent: 80px;text-align: justify;">
                    There is a crow who hates himself for his voice and his appearence. It always compares with others 
                    in all situations and felt bad. It always blamed God for giving such a life. One day the Crow was 
                    flying over a jungle and saw few Peacockfeathers laying there in an open place near a tree. Seeing those feathers
                    Crow felt happy and an got an idea. As the crow doesn't like his appearence it want to change his appearence as a Peacock.
                </p><br>
                <p style="text-indent: 80px;text-align: justify;">
                    The Crow then stick those feathers to it's tail and wandering round the jungle. At that time an old crow 
                    saw him and scolded the crow for his behaviour and said "Whatever you do. You can't change yourself at the
                    end you are a crow." Even though the crow listened his words he negleted and joined with the Peacock group. 
                </p><br>
                <p style="text-indent: 80px;text-align: justify;">
                    At the same time the climate become pleasent and it starts raining. All the Peacocks flickup their feathers
                    and starts dancing and singing. On seeing them crow also started singing as Ka-Ka-Ka . All the peacocks shockingly
                    stare at crow as they didn't know how the crow joined their group. Those peacocks pluck the feathers of the crow 
                    and make him ran away. 
                </p><br>
                <p style="text-indent: 80px;text-align: justify;">
                    The old crow again saw the crow and said " You are always a crow and you cann't change it. Stay happy and
                    be happy with your friends and family." The crow now understood that and again joined with his family.
